- The post-graduation work permit (PGWP) allows students who have graduated from eligible schools to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Graduating from a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) does not automatically make you eligible for a PGWP.

- As of November 1, 2024, the eligibility requirements for a PGWP have changed. Applicants who submitted their PGWP application before that date or are flight school graduates are exempt from the new requirements.

- The length of a post-graduation work permit depends on the level and duration of the study program as well as the expiry date of the applicant's passport, whichever comes first. For example, master's degree programs may qualify for a 3-year PGWP, while other programs may be eligible for varying durations based on program length.

- If an applicant's passport expires before their PGWP, they must ensure their passport is valid for the full PGWP eligibility period before applying. The work permit will only be issued for the valid passport duration, and applicants can apply for an extension after obtaining a new valid passport.
